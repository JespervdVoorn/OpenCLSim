===================
Version conventions
===================

This package is being developed continously. Branch protection is applied to the master branch. Useful new features and bugfixes can be developed in a separate branch or fork. Pull requests can be made to integrate updates into the master branch. To keep track of versions, every change to the master branch will receive a version tag. The page explains the rationale behind the release tags. 

Each package release is stamped with a version tag, that is a sequence based version identifier. Each identifier contains three numbers: A major change identifier, followed by a medium change idenfier and a minor change identifier. This leads to tags of the form:

x.y.z

The numbers indicate change significance:

- Major changes (typically breaking changes)  -> x + 1
- Medium changes (think of new features) -> y + 1
- Minor changes (think of bug fixes and updates in documentation -> z + 1
